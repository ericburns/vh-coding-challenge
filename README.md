# Vegan Hacktivists Coding Challenge

The project was built with the Laravel project creator. I have no previous experience with PHP / Laravel, so this was completed with the aid of the Laravel documentation.

## Running the project

### Terminal 1
1. `./vendor/bin/sail up`

### Terminal 2
1. `./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate`
